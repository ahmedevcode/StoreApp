# StoreApp
flutter project with Api
Excited to announce the completion of my latest Flutter app, Store! ðŸŽ‰âœ¨
a simple e-commerce app showcases my expertise in fetching products from a fake API and displaying them beautifully using Flutter packages.
I made it using:
-http package: to fetch the data from API
-Cached Images
-Future Builder: to create Widgets Based on the Api Response.
-Reusable components
-Shimmer animation (skeletons): while loading components
